# Privacy-preserving-homomorphic-encryption-scheme
 This code uses the cryptography library to generate a private/public key pair, serialize the keys, and encrypt and decrypt a message using the keys. The encryption and decryption operations use an Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP) scheme, which is a type of homomorphic encryption that allows the encrypted data to be manipulated without revealing the original plaintext. Keep in mind that this is just an example and may not be production-ready code. You may need to handle errors more gracefully and add additional error checking and handling as needed for your specific use case.
